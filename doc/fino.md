# Overview


Fino is a free and open source tool released under the terms of the GPLv3+ that uses the finite-element method to solve

 * steady or quasistatic thermo-mechanical problems, or
 * steady or transient heat conduction problems, or
 * modal analysis problems.

# Running `fino`

## Invocation

The format for running the `fino` program is:

```
fino [options] inputfile [optional_extra_arguments]...
```

The `fino` executable supports the following options:


include(help.md)


## Example input files

### Minimum working example

The following is a MWE input file for Fino that reads a Gmsh-generated `.msh` file, solves a linear elastic problem and wriets the results in a `.vtk` file which can be post-processed by Paraview:

```
include(../examples/tensile-mwe.fin)
```

### Extended annotated example

The example can be extended to give more information as the following annotated input shows:

```
include(../examples/tensile-test.fin)
```
