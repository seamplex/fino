.PP
The Stress Classification Line (SCL) may be given either as a
one-dimensional physical entity in the mesh or as the (continuous)
spatial coordinates of two end-points.
If the SCL is given as a \f[C]PHYSICAL_GROUP\f[R], the entity should be
one-dimensional (i.e a line) independently of the dimension of the
problem.
If the SCL is given with \f[C]START_POINT\f[R] and \f[C]END_POINT\f[R],
the number of coordinates given should match the problem dimension (i.e
three coordinates for full\ 3D problems and two coordinates for
axisymmetric or plane problems).
Coordinates can be given algebraic expressions that will be evaluated at
the time of the linearization.
If either a \f[C]FILE\f[R] or a \f[C]FILE_PATH\f[R] is given, the total,
membrane and membrane plus bending stresses are written as a function of
a scalar \f[I]t\f[R]\[u2004]\[mo]\[u2004][0,\[u2006]1].
Moreover, the individual elements of the membrane and bending stress
tensors are written within comments (i.e.\ lines starting with the hash
symbol \f[C]#\f[R]).
By default, the linearization uses the Von\ Mises criterion for the
composition of stresses.
The definition of what \f[I]total stress\f[R] means can be changed using
the \f[C]TOTAL\f[R] keyword.
The membrane, bending and peak stress tensor elements are combined using
the Von\ Mises criterion and stored as variables.
If no name for any of the variables is given, they are stored in
\f[C]M_entity\f[R], \f[C]B_entity\f[R] and \f[C]P_entity\f[R]
respectively if there is a physical entity.
Otherwise \f[C]M_1\f[R], \f[C]B_1\f[R] and \f[C]P_1\f[R] for the first
instruction, \f[C]M_2\f[R]\&... etc.

\f[C]mechanical\f[R] (or \f[C]elastic\f[R] or \f[C]break\f[R], default)
solves the mechanical elastic problem (default).

\f[C]thermal\f[R] (or \f[C]heat\f[R] or \f[C]bake\f[R]) solves the heat

\f[C]modal\f[R] (or \f[C]shake\f[R]) computes the natural frequencies
and oscillation modes.
.PP
If the \f[C]AXISYMMETRIC\f[R] keyword is given, the mesh is expected to
be two-dimensional in the \f[I]x\f[R]-\f[I]y\f[R] plane and the problem
is assumed to be axi-symmetric around the axis given by
\f[C]SYMMETRY_AXIS\f[R] (default is \f[I]y\f[R]).
If the problem type is mechanical and the mesh is two-dimensional on the
\f[I]x\f[R]-\f[I]y\f[R] plane and no axisymmetry is given, either
\f[C]PLANE_STRESS\f[R] and \f[C]PLAIN_STRAIN\f[R] can be provided
(default is plane stress).
By default Fino tries to detect wheter the computation should be linear
or non-linear.
An explicit mode can be set with either \f[C]LINEAR\f[R] on
\f[C]NON_LINEAR\f[R].
The number of spatial dimensions of the problem needs to be given either
with the keyword \f[C]DIMENSIONS\f[R] or by defining a \f[C]MESH\f[R]
(with an explicit \f[C]DIMENSIONS\f[R] keyword) before
\f[C]FINO_PROBLEM\f[R].
If there are more than one \f[C]MESH\f[R]es define, the one over which
the problem is to be solved can be defined by giving the explicit mesh
name with \f[C]MESH\f[R].
By default, the first mesh to be defined in the input file is the one
over which the problem is solved.
The number of modes to be computed in the modal problem.
The default is DEFAULT_NMODES.

The result is stored in the variable or vector provided, depending on
the number of degrees of freedoms of the problem.
If the object passed as \f[C]RESULT\f[R] does not exist, an appropriate
object (scalar variable or vector) is created.
For the elastic problem, the components of the total reaction force are
stored in the result vector.
For the thermal problem, the total power passing through the entity is
computed as an scalar.

If either \f[C]PC_TYPE\f[R] or \f[C]KSP_TYPE\f[R] is set to
\f[C]mumps\f[R] (and PETSc is compiled with MUMPS support) then this
direct solver is used.
For the mechanical problem, the default is to use GAMG as the
preconditioner and PETSc\[cq]s default solver (GMRES).
For the thermal problem, the default is to use the default PETSc
settings.
For the modal problem, the default is to use the default SLEPc settings.
The \f[C]GRADIENT\f[R] keyword controls how the derivatives
(i.e.\ strains) at the first-order nodes are to be computed out of the
primary unknowns (i.e.\ displacements).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]gauss\f[R] (default) computes the derivatives at the gauss points
and the extrapolates the values to the nodes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]nodes\f[R] computes the derivatives direcetly at the nodes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]none\f[R] does not compute any derivative at all
.PP
The way derivatives are computed at high-order nodes (i.e.\ those at the
middle of edges or faces) is controlled with \f[C]GRADIENT_HIGHER\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]average\f[R] (default) assigns the plain average of the first-order
nodes that surrond each high-order node
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]none\f[R] computes the derivatives at the location of the
high-order nodes
.PP
The keyword \f[C]SMOOTH\f[R] controls how the gradient-based functions
(i.e.\ strains, stresses, etc) are smoothed\[em]or not\[em]to obtain
nodal values out of data which primarily comes from element-wise
evaluations at the Gauss points.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]always\f[R] (default) computes a single value for each node by
averaging the contributions of individual elements.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]never\f[R] keeps the contribution of each individual element
separate.
This option implies that the output mesh is different from the input
mesh as each element now has a \[lq]copy\[rq] of the original shared
nodes.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]material\f[R] averages element contribution only for those elements
that belong to the same material (i.e.\ physical group).
As with \f[C]never\f[R], a new output mesh is created where the nodes
are duplicated even for those elements which belong to the same physical
group.
.PP
The way individual contributions of different elements to the same node
are averaged is controlled by \f[C]ELEMENT_WEIGHT\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]volume_times_quality\f[R] (default) weights each element by the
product of its volume times its quality
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]volume\f[R] weights each element by the its volume
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]quality\f[R] weights each element by the its quality
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]flat\f[R] performs plain averages (i.e.\ the same weight for all
elements)

If there will be only one mesh in the input file, the \f[C]NAME\f[R] is
optional.
Yet it might be needed in cases where there are many meshes and one
needs to refer to a particular mesh, such as in \f[C]MESH_POST\f[R] or
\f[C]MESH_INTEGRATE\f[R].
When solving PDEs (such as in Fino or milonga), the first mesh is the
problem mesh.
Either a file identifier (defined previously with a \f[C]FILE\f[R]
keyword) or a file path should be given.
The format is read from the extension, which should be either
.IP \[bu] 2

.PP
Note than only MSH is suitable for defining PDE domains, as it is the
only one that provides information about physical groups.
The spatial dimensions should be given with \f[C]DIMENSION\f[R].
If material properties are uniform and given with variables, the
dimensions are not needed and will be read from the file.
But if spatial functions are needed (either for properties or read from
the mesh file), an explicit value for the mesh dimensions is needed.
If either \f[C]SCALE\f[R] or \f[C]OFFSET\f[R] are given, the node
position if first shifted and then scaled by the provided amounts.
For each \f[C]READ_SCALAR\f[R] keyword, a point-wise defined function of
space named \f[C]<function_name>\f[R] is defined and filled with the
scalar data named \f[C]<name_in_mesh>\f[R] contained in the mesh file.
The \f[C]READ_FUNCTION\f[R] keyword is a shortcut when the scalar name
and the to-be-defined function are the same.
If no \f[C]NAME\f[R] is given, the first mesh to be defined is called
\f[C]first\f[R].

The vector to be filled needs to be already defined and to have the
appropriate size, either the number of nodes or cells of the mesh
depending on \f[C]NODES\f[R] or \f[C]CELLS\f[R] (default is nodes).
The elements of the vectors will be either the \f[C]FUNCTION\f[R] or the
\f[C]EXPRESSION\f[R] of \f[I]x\f[R], \f[I]y\f[R] and \f[I]z\f[R]
evaluated at the nodes or cells of the provided mesh.

The integrand may be either a \f[C]FUNCTION\f[R] or an
\f[C]EXPRESSION\f[R].
In the first case, just the function name is expected (i.e.\ not its
arguments).
In the second case, a full algebraic expression including the arguments
is expected.
If the expression is just \f[C]1\f[R] then the volume (or area or
length) of the domain is computed.
Note that arguments ought to be \f[C]x\f[R], \f[C]y\f[R] and/or
\f[C]z\f[R].
If there are more than one mesh defined, an explicit one has to be given
with \f[C]MESH\f[R].
By default the integration is performed over the highest-dimensional
elements of the mesh.
If the integration is to be carried out over just a physical group, it
has to be given in \f[C]OVER\f[R].
Either \f[C]NODES\f[R] or \f[C]CELLS\f[R] define how the integration is
to be performed.
In the first case a the integration is performed using the Gauss points
and weights associated to each element type.
In the second case, the integral is computed as the sum of the product
of the function evaluated at the center of each cell (element) and the
cell\[cq]s volume.
The scalar result of the integration is stored in the variable given by
\f[C]RESULT\f[R].
If the variable does not exist, it is created.
In the second case, a full algebraic expression including the arguments
is expected.

A name is mandatory for each physical group defined within the input
file.
If there is no physical group with the provided name in the mesh, this
instruction makes no effect.
If there are many meshes, an explicit mesh can be given with
\f[C]MESH\f[R].
Otherwise, the physical group is defined on the main mesh.
An explicit dimension of the physical group can be provided with
\f[C]DIMENSION\f[R].
For volumetric elements, physical groups can be linked to materials
using \f[C]MATERIAL\f[R].
Note that if a material is created with the same name as a physical
group in the mesh, they will be linked automatically.
The \f[C]MATERIAL\f[R] keyword in \f[C]PHYSICAL_GROUP\f[R] is used to
link a physical group in a mesh file and a material in the wasora input
file with different names.
For non-volumetric elements, boundary conditions can be assigned by
using the \f[C]BC\f[R] keyword.
This should be the last keyword of the line, and any token afterwards is
treated specially by the underlying solver (i.e.\ Fino or milonga).

The function with the data has to be point-wise defined.
The function to be fitted hast to be parametrized with at least one of
the variables provided after the \f[C]VIA\f[R] keyword.
Only the names of the functions have to be given.
Both functions have to have the same number of arguments.
The initial guess of the solution is given by the initial value of the
variables listed in the \f[C]VIA\f[R] keyword.
Analytical expressions for the gradient of the function to be fitted
with respect to the parameters to be fitted can be optionally given with
the \f[C]GRADIENT\f[R] keyword.
If none is provided, the gradient will be computed numerically using
finite differences.
A range over which the residuals are to be minimized can be given with
\f[C]RANGE_MIN\f[R] and \f[C]RANGE_MAX\f[R].
For multidimensional fits, the range is an hypercube.
If no range is given, all the definition points of the function witht
the data are used for the fit.
Convergence can be controlled by given the relative and absolute
tolreances with \f[C]DELTAEPSREL\f[R] (default 1e-4) and
\f[C]DELTAEPSABS\f[R] (default 1e-6), and with the maximum number of

The number of variables \f[I]n\f[R] is given by the number of arguments
given between parenthesis after the function name.
The arguments are defined as new variables if they had not been already
defined as variables.
If the function is given as an algebraic expression, the short-hand
operator \f[C]:=\f[R] can be used.
That is to say, \f[C]FUNCTION f(x) = x\[ha]2\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[C]f(x) := x\[ha]2\f[R].
If a \f[C]FILE_PATH\f[R] is given, an ASCII file containing at least
\f[I]n\f[R]\[u2005]+\[u2005]1 columns is expected.
By default, the first \f[I]n\f[R] columns are the values of the
arguments and the last column is the value of the function at those
points.
The order of the columns can be changed with the keyword
\f[C]COLUMNS\f[R], which expects \f[I]n\f[R]\[u2005]+\[u2005]1
expressions corresponding to the column numbers.
A function of type \f[C]ROUTINE\f[R] calls an already-defined
user-provided routine using the \f[C]CALL\f[R] keyword and passes the
values of the variables in each required evaluation as a
\f[C]double *\f[R] argument.
If \f[C]MESH\f[R] is given, the definition points are the nodes or the
cells of the mesh.
The function arguments should be (\f[I]x\f[R]),
(\f[I]x\f[R],\[u2006]\f[I]y\f[R]) or
(\f[I]x\f[R],\[u2006]\f[I]y\f[R],\[u2006]\f[I]z\f[R]) matching the
dimension the mesh.
If the keyword \f[C]DATA\f[R] is used, a new empty vector of the
appropriate size is defined.
The elements of this new vector can be assigned to the values of the
function at the \f[I]i\f[R]-th node or cell.
If the keyword \f[C]VECTOR\f[R] is used, the values of the dependent
variable are taken to be the values of the already-existing vector.
Note that this vector should have the size of the number of nodes or
cells the mesh has, depending on whether \f[C]NODES\f[R] or
\f[C]CELLS\f[R] is given.
If \f[C]VECTOR_DATA\f[R] is given, a set of
\f[I]n\f[R]\[u2005]+\[u2005]1 vectors of the same size is expected.
The first \f[I]n\f[R]\[u2005]+\[u2005]1 correspond to the arguments and
the last one is the function value.
Interpolation schemes can be given for either one or multi-dimensional
functions with \f[C]INTERPOLATION\f[R].
Available schemes for \f[I]n\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]1 are:
.IP \[bu] 2
linear
.IP \[bu] 2
polynomial, the grade is equal to the number of data minus one
.IP \[bu] 2

(more efficient evaluation provided \f[C]SHEPARD_RADIUS\f[R] is set to a
proper value)
.IP \[bu] 2
bilinear, only available if the definition points configure an
structured hypercube-like grid.
If \f[I]n\f[R]\[u2004]>\[u2004]3, \f[C]SIZES\f[R] should be given.
.PP
For \f[I]n\f[R]\[u2004]>\[u2004]1, if the euclidean distance between the
arguments and the definition points is smaller than
\f[C]INTERPOLATION_THRESHOLD\f[R], the definition point is returned and
no interpolation is performed.
Default value is square root of \f[C]9.5367431640625e-07\f[R].
The initial radius of points to take into account in
\f[C]shepard_kd\f[R] is given by \f[C]SHEPARD_RADIUS\f[R].
If no points are found, the radius is double until at least one
definition point is found.
The radius is doubled until at least one point is found.
Default is \f[C]1.0\f[R].
The exponent of the \f[C]shepard\f[R] method is given by
\f[C]SHEPARD_EXPONENT\f[R].
Default is \f[C]2\f[R].
When requesting \f[C]bilinear\f[R] interpolation for
\f[I]n\f[R]\[u2004]>\[u2004]3, the number of definition points for each
argument variable has to be given with \f[C]SIZES\f[R], and wether the
definition data is sorted with the first argument changing first
(\f[C]X_INCREASES_FIRST\f[R] evaluating to non-zero) or with the last
argument changing first (zero).
The function can be pointwise-defined inline in the input using
\f[C]DATA\f[R].
This should be the last keyword of the line, followed by
\f[I]N\f[R]\[u2004]=\[u2004]\f[I]k\f[R]\[u2005]\[md]\[u2005](\f[I]n\f[R]\[u2005]+\[u2005]1)
expresions giving \f[I]k\f[R] definition points: \f[I]n\f[R] arguments
and the value of the function.
Multiline continuation using brackets \f[C]{\f[R] and \f[C]}\f[R] can be
used for a clean data organization.

By default, wasora allows variables (but not vectors nor matrices) to be
implicitly declared.
To avoid introducing errors due to typos, explicit declaration of
variables can be forced by giving \f[C]IMPLICIT NONE\f[R].

Each argument \f[C]object\f[R] that is not a keyword is expected to be
part of the output, can be either a matrix, a vector, an scalar
algebraic expression.
If the given object cannot be solved into a valid matrix, vector or
expression, it is treated as a string literal if \f[C]IMPLICIT\f[R] is
\f[C]ALLOWED\f[R], otherwise a parser error is raised.
To explicitly interpret an object as a literal string even if it
resolves to a valid numerical expression, it should be prefixed with the
\f[C]TEXT\f[R] keyword.
Hashes \f[C]#\f[R] appearing literal in text strings have to be quoted
to prevent the parser to treat them as comments within the wasora input
file and thus ignoring the rest of the line.
Whenever an argument starts with a porcentage sign \f[C]%\f[R], it is
treated as a C \f[C]printf\f[R]-compatible format definition and all the
objects that follow it are printed using the given format until a new
format definition is found.
The objects are treated as double-precision floating point numbers, so
only floating point formats should be given.
The default format is \f[C]\[dq]%g\[dq]\f[R].
Matrices, vectors, scalar expressions, format modifiers and string
literals can be given in any desired order, and are processed from left
to right.
Vectors are printed element-by-element in a single row.
See \f[C]PRINT_VECTOR\f[R] to print vectors column-wise.
Matrices are printed element-by-element in a single line using row-major
ordering if mixed with other objects but in the natural row and column
fashion if it is the only given object.
If the \f[C]FILE\f[R] keyword is not provided, default is to write to
stdout.
If the \f[C]NONEWLINE\f[R] keyword is not provided, default is to write
a newline \f[C]\[rs]n\f[R] character after all the objects are
processed.
The \f[C]SEP\f[R] keywords expects a string used to separate printed
objects, the default is a tab `DEFAULT_PRINT_SEPARATOR' character.
Use the \f[C]NOSEP\f[R] keyword to define an empty string as object
separator.
If the \f[C]HEADER\f[R] keyword is given, a single line containing the
literal text given for each object is printed at the very first time the
\f[C]PRINT\f[R] instruction is processed, starting with a hash
\f[C]#\f[R] character.
If the \f[C]SKIP_STEP\f[R] (\f[C]SKIP_STATIC_STEP\f[R])keyword is given,
the instruction is processed only every the number of transient (static)
steps that results in evaluating the expression, which may not be
constant.
By default the \f[C]PRINT\f[R] instruction is evaluated every step.
The \f[C]SKIP_HEADER_STEP\f[R] keyword works similarly for the optional
\f[C]HEADER\f[R] but by default it is only printed once.
The \f[C]SKIP_TIME\f[R] keyword use time advancements to choose how to
skip printing and may be useful for non-constant time-step problems.
